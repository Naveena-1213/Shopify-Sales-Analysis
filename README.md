# Shopify-Sales-Analysis
## Background & Overview
In today’s fast-paced e-commerce environment, data-driven decision-making is crucial for optimizing performance and driving growth.

This project focuses on just one week of Shopify sales data, from which core metrics were created and dynamic dashboards were developed purely for analytical purposes.

### Objective
By analyzing this one-week dataset, we aim to highlight quick trends in customer behavior, product performance, and funnel conversion, enabling business owners to make immediate, informed decisions. The dashboards transform raw transactional data into clear, visually compelling insights that are easy to interpret and act on.

## Data Structure Overview
The dataset used is a comprehensive transactional export from Shopify, capturing multiple dimensions of the sales funnel. Below is a breakdown of the fields included:

 * `Admin Graphql API Id`: Shopify’s internal unique line item ID for precise record tracking.

 * `Order Number`: Sequential order identifier, essential for tracking sales events.

 * `Billing Address Country, Province, City, Zip`: Geographic fields enabling regional segmentation and targeted marketing insights.

 * `Billing Address First Name, Last Name`: Customer identifiers used for loyalty and personalization analysis (anonymized in public reporting).

 * `Currency`: Currency of transaction, supporting multi-region revenue analysis.

 * `Customer Id`: Unique customer identifier, key for customer lifetime value (CLV) and cohort analysis.

 * `Invoice Date`: Transaction timestamp, enabling time-based trend and seasonality analysis.

 * `Gateway`: Payment method (e.g., Shopify Payments), useful for understanding payment preferences and friction points.

 * `Product Id, Variant Id`: Identifiers for product-level and variant-level performance tracking.

 * `Product Type`: Broad category (e.g., Climbing Shoes), supporting category contribution insights.

 * `Quantity`: Number of units sold per line item, crucial for demand analysis and inventory planning.

 * `Subtotal Price`: Pre-tax transaction value.

 * `Total Price USD`: Final paid amount including taxes, reflecting true revenue impact.

 * `Total Tax`: Collected tax amount, important for compliance and financial reporting.

## Executive Summary
The Shopify sales funnel analysis uncovered clear signals on customer purchasing patterns and revenue dynamics. Key takeaways:

 * High-value customers tend to cluster geographically, suggesting opportunities for region-focused marketing.

 * Certain product types consistently outperform in both quantity and revenue, indicating strong product-market fit.

 * Repeat customer purchases represent a significant share of total revenue, underlining the importance of retention strategies.

 * Payment gateway preferences reveal friction points in conversion, providing a clear path to optimize checkout experiences.

## Insights Deep Dive
###  * Top Revenue-Generating Products

Running Shoes and similar high-ticket items contribute disproportionately to overall revenue despite lower unit sales volume.

###  * Geographic Hotspots

States like Texas and cities such as Houston dominate sales volumes, suggesting localized promotional strategies could drive further growth.

###  * Payment Preferences & Conversion

Shopify Payments emerges as the most popular gateway, but analysis suggests alternative payment methods could capture additional market share.

###  * Repeat vs. First-Time Customers

High CLV segments show strong repeat purchase behavior, emphasizing the importance of loyalty campaigns and personalized retargeting.
