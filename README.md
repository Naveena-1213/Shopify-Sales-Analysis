# Shopify-Sales-Analysis
## Background & Overview
In today’s fast-paced e-commerce landscape, understanding the customer journey from first purchase to repeat loyalty is critical.
This project focuses on analyzing detailed Shopify sales data to uncover actionable business insights that improve customer retention, optimize product performance, and drive revenue growth.

### Objective:
The goal is to move beyond surface-level metrics and deeply explore the funnel dynamics, highlighting patterns in purchase behavior, regional trends, and product category performance.

## Data Structure Overview
The dataset used is a comprehensive transactional export from Shopify, capturing multiple dimensions of the sales funnel. Below is a breakdown of the fields included:

 * `Admin Graphql API Id`: Shopify’s internal unique line item ID for precise record tracking.

 * `Order Number`: Sequential order identifier, essential for tracking sales events.

 * `Billing Address Country, Province, City, Zip`: Geographic fields enabling regional segmentation and targeted marketing insights.

 * `Billing Address First Name, Last Name`: Customer identifiers used for loyalty and personalization analysis (anonymized in public reporting).

 * `Currency`: Currency of transaction, supporting multi-region revenue analysis.

 * `Customer Id`: Unique customer identifier, key for customer lifetime value (CLV) and cohort analysis.

 * `Invoice Date`: Transaction timestamp, enabling time-based trend and seasonality analysis.

 * `Gateway`: Payment method (e.g., Shopify Payments), useful for understanding payment preferences and friction points.

 * `Product Id, Variant Id`: Identifiers for product-level and variant-level performance tracking.

 * `Product Type`: Broad category (e.g., Climbing Shoes), supporting category contribution insights.

 * `Quantity`: Number of units sold per line item, crucial for demand analysis and inventory planning.

 * `Subtotal Price`: Pre-tax transaction value.

 * `Total Price USD`: Final paid amount including taxes, reflecting true revenue impact.

 * `Total Tax`: Collected tax amount, important for compliance and financial reporting.

## Executive Summary
The Shopify sales funnel analysis uncovered clear signals on customer purchasing patterns and revenue dynamics. Key takeaways:

 * High-value customers tend to cluster geographically, suggesting opportunities for region-focused marketing.

 * Certain product types consistently outperform in both quantity and revenue, indicating strong product-market fit.

 * Repeat customer purchases represent a significant share of total revenue, underlining the importance of retention strategies.

 * Payment gateway preferences reveal friction points in conversion, providing a clear path to optimize checkout experiences.

## Insights Deep Dive
###  * Top Revenue-Generating Products

Running Shoes and similar high-ticket items contribute disproportionately to overall revenue despite lower unit sales volume.

###  * Geographic Hotspots

States like Texas and cities such as Houston dominate sales volumes, suggesting localized promotional strategies could drive further growth.

###  * Payment Preferences & Conversion

Shopify Payments emerges as the most popular gateway, but analysis suggests alternative payment methods could capture additional market share.

###  * Repeat vs. First-Time Customers

High CLV segments show strong repeat purchase behavior, emphasizing the importance of loyalty campaigns and personalized retargeting.
